acsi_mambo:

	Need to rewrite comms node to send and recieve the correct messages now that its been changed.
	Need to make position controller with correct internal gains for the position controller for mambo. The current system should work
	Need to determine what the feedforward thrust should be and tune the height controller in accordance to the original controller
	Need to make sure the axis are appropriately aligned
	
acsi_crazyflie:
	
	Need to fix the drone physically
	Write trajectory handling into PID position controller for minimum project completion (possibly add height integrator or integration in general)
	Need to program MPC into the position controller 
	Need to determine the correct plant for MPC from isolated model


general:

	Write state machine with GUI in Kivy or Javascript
	Need to go through and seperate the nodes from the python libraries
	Integrate the mambo
	Add Source One support
