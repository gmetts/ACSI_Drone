# Optitrack

This part of the ROS package was developed by the [Control Robotics Intelligence Group](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/cuong/) from the [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](http://www.ntu.edu.sg). This package allows to receive in ROS the rigid bodies streamed by Motive 1.7. Checkout https://github.com/crigroup/optitrack for more information. 

ACSI derives a lot of Optitrack code from their work. However their setup uses Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04. So we have upgraded the setup to use Ubuntu 16.04. Keep following instructions from https://github.com/CMU-ACSI/CrazyFlie/tree/master/crazyflie_ws if you haven't already done so.
